Here's a step-by-step list for how I ran things. 

1. Downloaded, imported, and unzipped the raw fastq files into a 14_RADseq_data directory within my main nuthatch directory (alias: nuts). 

2. Created the RenameRADSeq.txt file in the same directory and used it to rename the files. 

3. Downloaded STACKS via conda and created a new STACKS environment. 

4. Created the 15_STACKS directory. 

5. Ran Process_RADTags.sh script from the 15_STACKS directory.

6. Created a "trimmed" directory within 15_STACKS. 

7. Ran End_Trimming.sh within 15_STACKS.

8. Created a "aligned" directory within 15_STACKS. 

9. Ran Align_RAD_data.sh within 15_STACKS. 

10.
